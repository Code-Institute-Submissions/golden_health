    <li>Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go the page of their choice and a search bar to go straight to the product of their choice. Underneath there is an Image with the text "Explore our wide range of teas" and a "Shop Now" call to action button.

    <li>The title makes it clear what the primary purpose of the site is </li>
    <li>The user has two options, click the call to action button or use the navigation buttons to view the products.</li>
    <li>When the user clicks into each product, there is a summary of the product allowing them to learn more about it.</li>
</ul>

<h5>As a first-time visitor, I want to navigate throughout the site to find products quickly.</h5>

<ul>
    <li>The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. There is a clean navigation bar at the top of each page; each link describes what page they will end up at. The navigation is fixed on the screen so no matter how far down the screen the user scrolls, they will never be stuck.</li>
    <li>There is a button to take the user back to the top of the page on all screens at the bottom right-hand side on the All Products, Tea and Teaware pages. So the user doesn't feel trapped when they get to the bottom of the page. On smaller screens the button also appears in checkout.</li>
    <li>The site has a search bar so the user can easily find any product they want effortlessly.</li>
    <li>On each products page, there is a filtering system so users can sort by: Price, Rating, Name, Category</li>
</ul>

Once the form has been filled out they will recieve a verification email. Once they have clicked the link to verify their account, there profile will be up and running.</li>
    <li>Once the user is logged in the My Account icon changes to give the user the ability to view their profile or logout. Once logout is clicked to verify the user does indeed want to logout they are taken to a page which allows them to cancel and go back or press sign out which will log them out and return the user to the home page</li>
</ul>

<h5>As a first time user, I want to be able to read reviews from other users giving me a deeper understanding of the product</h5>

    <li>When searching through the product pages, there is a sort by the filter at the top right of the screen allowing users to adapt the filter to show what they want to be displayed first whether it be sorting them by name, price, rating or categoryâ€”thus allowing users to alter their search.</li>

    <li>The site is made to be as simple to use as possible. I wanted users to log in and out just as quickly as moving from one page to another. </li>
    <li>Once the user is logged in the My Account icon changes to give the user the ability to view their profile or logout, once log out is clicked to verify the user does indeed want to logout they are taken to a page which allows them to cancel and go back or press sign out which will log them out and return the user to the home page. </li>
</ul>

<h5>As a returning visitor, I want to be able to see what I have purchased in the past</h5>

<ul>
    <li>When a user is logged in, if they click the My Account icon, it will show two options My Profile and Logout.

<h2><u>Known Bugs</u></h2>

<ul>
    <li>In heroku when going to checkout, the payment section is not showing;and when going to pay an error occurs. Even though stripe is fully functioning. The stripe function has worked perfectly in the past, but at the time of writing this heroku is showing an error.</li>
</ul>

<h2><u>Deployment</u></h2>
<h3>Heroku</h3>
<p>The project was developed using Gitpod, commited to git and pushed to Github. My GitHub is linked with Heroku, so anything i pushed to GitHub automatically got deployed to Heroku. I used AWS S3 as storage. When i pushed my code to Heroku i had to make sure all my static files were in my storage AWS S3 as otherwise none of my images or CSS would show. </p>

<h3>Making a Local Clone</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Log in to Githun and locate the GitHub Repository</li>
    <li>Under the repository name (golden_health), click the "Clone or download"</li>
    <li>To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS" copy the link.</li>
    <li>In your local IDE open Git Bash</li>
    <li>Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made</li>
    <li>Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied from the clone in the HTTP's section <br>
